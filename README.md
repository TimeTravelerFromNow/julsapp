# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
2.7.4
* System dependencies

* Configuration
run `bundle install`

* Database creation
run `rake db:migrate`

* Database initialization
I did mess with
    # config.active_record.schema_format = :sql
  in `application.rb`. Not entirely sure why, but I was debugging some `schema.rb` database missing issue

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
Not ready for production.
